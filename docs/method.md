# The SiMaster method

## Data model

Each input field provides three maps (HEALPix RING or healsparse):

- `signal` — the observed map,
- `mask` — multiplicative response `w`,
- `ivar` — per-pixel inverse noise variance.

The model is `observed = w * s + n`, with `n ~ N(0, 1/ivar)` independent per
pixel, so the noise covariance `N` is diagonal in pixel space by
construction. Pixels with `w == 0` *or* `ivar == 0` are removed from the
data vector entirely (infinite noise = zero weight). A spin-0 field
contributes one map, a spin-2 field contributes `[Q, U]` and its spectra are
E and B.

`N` need not be strictly diagonal: passing a `PixelNoiseCov`
(`QMLWorkspace(..., noise_cov=...)`) lets it carry small **per-sky-pixel
blocks** — e.g. the 3×3 I/Q/U covariance that couples a spin-0 (I) field and a
spin-2 (Q, U) field, as in the Planck NPIPE `wcov` products. `N` stays
block-diagonal in pixel space (matrix-free); `apply`/`apply_inv`/`sqrt`/`Vᵀ N V`
all have exact per-block analogues, and the preconditioner uses the true
`diag(N⁻¹)`. Pixel–pixel correlations remain out of scope. Build both fields
and the coupled noise in one call with `simaster.iqu_from_cov` (see api.md).

The concatenated data vector `x` over all field components has covariance

```
C = U Ĉ Uᵀ + N (+ Σ_j α_j t_j t_jᵀ),     U = W Y B,
```

where `Y` is the synthesis matrix of *real* orthonormal spherical harmonics
(real basis: the coefficient covariance of an isotropic field is strictly
block-diagonal, one `(ncomp × ncomp)` spectrum block `C_l` per `(l, m)`
mode, and all algebra stays real), `W` the mask, `B` optional beams, and
`t_j` are templates to marginalize.

## Estimator

SiMaster implements the Tegmark (1997) QML estimator generalized to multiple
correlated fields and bandpowers flat in `C_l`:

```
y_A(x)  = 1/2 xᵀ M P_A M x,        P_A = ∂C/∂c_A
ĉ       = R⁻¹ (y(x) − n),          n_A = 1/2 Tr[M N M P_A]
R_AB    = 1/2 Tr[M P_A M P_B],     cov(ĉ) ≈ R⁻¹ at the fiducial
```

`A = (spectrum pair, band)`. The filter `M` is `C⁻¹` or its
template-deprojected pseudo-inverse (below). The estimator is **unbiased
for any fiducial spectrum** (only optimality degrades), which justifies
single-shot estimation around a fiducial; `QMLWorkspace.iterate` re-centers
the fiducial on the estimate (a Newton–Raphson step on the field-level
likelihood).

Computing `y` is cheap: one filtered vector `z = M x`, one adjoint SHT
`a = BᵀYᵀWᵀz`, and per-spectrum products `Σ_k a_c a_d` accumulated per `l`
and per band.

## No dense matrices: CG with a guaranteed-SPD preconditioner

`M x` is computed by preconditioned conjugate gradients; the operator `C·x`
costs two SHTs (GEMMs on the dense backend) plus diagonal work, batched over
many right-hand sides. The preconditioner is the Woodbury inverse of the
isotropic approximation:

```
P⁻¹ = N⁻¹ − N⁻¹ U T Uᵀ N⁻¹,    T_l = (Ĉ_l⁻¹ + D_l)⁻¹
```

evaluated in a form valid for singular `Ĉ_l` (zero fiducial BB is fine).
`D` starts at the statistical mean `Σ_p w² ivar / 4π` of the mode response
`UᵀN⁻¹U` and, if CG ever detects an indefinite direction (possible on cut
skies because the true mode response is not diagonal), is escalated toward
the guaranteed upper bound `2 max_p(w² ivar) · npix/4π`, beyond which
`P⁻¹ ⪰ C⁻¹ ≻ 0` provably. Uniform-weight problems converge in ~10
iterations; strongly varying `w² ivar` costs more (the bound is then loose) —
this is the main performance caveat for highly anisotropic noise.

### Dense-Cholesky filter (`solver='cholesky'`)

CG convergence degrades with the conditioning of `C`: for signal-dominated
data `κ ~ max_l C_l/N_l` (true Planck 143 GHz noise gives `κ ~ 1e7`,
independent of nside), and no preconditioner/deflation combination in
SiMaster tames that regime — the slow subspace is the whole signal band.
`solver='cholesky'` sidesteps the iterative solver entirely: the dense
covariance is assembled once by applying the matrix-free operator to
identity column blocks (so it is exactly the same `C` as every other code
path, any SHT backend), factorized in place with LAPACK `dpotrf`, and every
filter application becomes two triangular solves.  Direct factorization is
insensitive to conditioning (float64 keeps `~16 − log10 κ` digits, i.e. ~9
digits at `κ = 1e7`), so this is the exact-filter option at true Planck
noise.  The price is `O(nrow²)` memory — ~69 GB at nside=64 for a T/Q/U
analysis with fsky 0.63 — making it a **CPU-node tool for nside ≤ 64**
(validation, ground truth, honest optimality comparisons); `'cg'` remains
the scalable default.  `deflation` is ignored (nothing to deflate) and the
factor is invalidated by `update_fiducial`/`iterate`.

## Deflated / recycled CG (`deflation`)

Every Fisher engine applies `M = C⁻¹` to **thousands** of right-hand sides
that all share the *same* `C`. The CG convergence rate is set by the spread
of the spectrum of `P⁻¹C`, and — because the preconditioner is a guaranteed
upper bound (`P⁻¹ ⪰ C⁻¹`, so `C ⪰ P` and every eigenvalue of `P⁻¹C` is `≥ 1`)
— the bulk sits at 1 with a tail of *large* eigenvalues: a handful of slow
cut-sky / anisotropic-noise directions that drag down every solve. Deflation
removes that subspace from the Krylov iteration once and amortizes the cost
over all the RHS.

Given a basis `W` (`nrow × k`) spanning the slow directions, with the
Galerkin coarse operator `E = Wᵀ C W` and projectors `P = I − C W E⁻¹ Wᵀ`,
`Pᵀ = I − W E⁻¹ (CW)ᵀ`, deflated CG solves the deflated system `P C x̃ = P b`
and reconstructs

```
x = W E⁻¹ Wᵀ b  +  Pᵀ x̃.
```

This is **exact for any full-rank `W`** — `C x = b` the instant the deflated
residual `P(b − C x̃)` vanishes (then `b − C x̃ ∈ range(CW) = ker P`, so
`C x = (I−P)b + P b = b`). The deflation space changes only the *speed*, never
the *answer*; tests check the recovered solution against plain CG to CG
tolerance. The per-iteration overhead is one projector `P v = v − (CW) E⁻¹
(Wᵀ v)`: with `CW` precomputed once (k operator applies) and `E⁻¹` stored
dense, it is small GEMMs and **no extra SHTs** (a dense `k×k` inverse, not a
LAPACK `cho_solve`, because inside the CG `while_loop` the custom-call
dispatch can cost more than the SHT itself).

`W` is built by **recycling** the Krylov information of a short instrumented
solve: PCG implicitly runs Lanczos on `P⁻¹C`, so the Ritz vectors of its
tridiagonal approximate the eigenvectors of `P⁻¹C`, and the *largest* Ritz
vectors are the slow directions (Lanczos resolves well-separated extreme
eigenvalues first, so a short `~2k`-step run captures them). This reuses
solves we do anyway — the defining feature of eigCG/recycled methods.

Set `deflation=k` (off by default). The harvested space matches the optimal
(dense largest-eigenvector) deflation of the same `k` and, on a masked,
anisotropic-noise problem at nside 16, cuts CG by **~1.9×** (e.g. 484→259
iterations, 1.8× wall-time on the dense backend; the relative gain is larger
for the matrix-free `ducc`/`s2fft` backends, where each iteration is an SHT
and the dense projector is negligible). The one-off harvest amortizes after
~1 solve, and memory is `O(nrow·k)`. `build_deflation()` exposes a manual
(re)build, e.g. after `update_fiducial` (which invalidates the stale space,
since `W` is tied to `C(fiducial)`). Natural next step: thick-restart to cap
the harvest memory, and per-iteration recycling across consecutive RHS.

## SHT backends (`dense` / `ducc` / `s2fft` / `almond`)

Every `C·x` needs a synthesis `Y` (real-basis coefficients → observed-pixel
map) and its **exact transpose** `Yᵀ`. The four backends differ only in how
that adjoint pair is realized; all agree to ~1e-13 and are interchangeable:

- **`dense`** — the real-basis synthesis matrix `Y`, restricted to observed
  pixels, is precomputed once (cached on disk) and stored on the device, so
  every SHT is a single GEMM. Memory is `N_obs · (lmax+1)²`, so this is the
  fastest backend for `nside ≤ 64` (≤ 256 on large GPUs). Default for
  `nside ≤ 64`.
- **`ducc`** — matrix-free transforms through ducc0 (the engine behind
  healpy), exact in double precision and multithreaded on the CPU. Memory is
  `O(N_obs)`, so it scales to `nside = 1024+`. The transform runs on the CPU
  via `jax.pure_callback`: correct and scalable, but each SHT crosses the
  host↔device boundary and is opaque to XLA fusion and autodiff. Default for
  `nside > 64`.
- **`s2fft`** — native-JAX matrix-free transforms ([s2fft](https://github.com/astro-informatics/s2fft)).
  The synthesis is `s2fft.inverse` evaluated inside XLA, so the whole
  `C·x` chain stays **on the accelerator** (no host round-trip) and is
  differentiable. We build `Y` by scattering the real coefficients into
  s2fft's 2-D `flm` layout — for spin 0 the conjugate-symmetric scalar
  coefficients, for spin 2 the spin-(+2) coefficients `−(E + iB)` with the
  E/B reality symmetry filling the negative-`m` half — and obtain `Yᵀ`
  exactly as `jax.linear_transpose` of that differentiable synthesis (**not**
  the quadrature-based `s2fft.forward`, which is only an approximate inverse
  on HEALPix). This is the route to a GPU SHT at `nside ≳ 256` and to an
  end-to-end differentiable likelihood; on a small fp64 GPU (or CPU-bound
  hardware) ducc0 is still competitive, since the win is on-device locality
  and fusion rather than raw FLOPs (see the report's feasibility section).

  **Caveat — requires a fixed s2fft.** Released s2fft (≤ 1.4.0) has a
  Wigner-d recursion-node bug: HEALPix rings sit at `cos θ` values that land
  exactly on Wigner-d nodes for spin ≠ 0, where an intermediate
  renormalization produces a silently-dropped NaN, so HEALPix **spin-2**
  synthesis carries ~5–13 % pointwise error (spin-0 is unaffected, and the
  shipped HEALPix tests only covered spin 0). This is fatal for QML, which
  relies on exact adjoint pairs. It is fixed on the upstream branch
  `fix/healpix-spin-recursion-node` (guard the renormalization at exact
  nodes). `S2fftSHT` **self-checks against ducc0 at construction** and raises
  a `RuntimeError` if the installed s2fft fails the spin-2 check, so an
  unpatched install cannot silently produce wrong spectra. The backend is
  therefore **opt-in** (`backend='s2fft'`), not selected by `'auto'`. Note
  that s2fft's HEALPix `forward`→`inverse` round trip still shows the usual
  few-percent HEALPix quadrature error — that is expected and irrelevant
  here, because QML uses `Yᵀ` (the exact transpose), never the quadrature
  `forward`.
- **`almond`** — matrix-free transforms through [Almond](../../almond), an
  in-house CUDA/CuPy SHT library implementing ducc0's exact algorithm on the
  GPU (spin-0 and spin-2, synthesis and exact adjoint `Yᵀ`, float64, healpy
  conventions, validated against ducc0 to ~1e-12). As of SiMaster 0.2 and
  Almond 0.5, an Almond solve imports the JAX RHS into CuPy once through
  DLPack, runs the full covariance, Woodbury preconditioner, and PCG loop on
  the GPU, then exports the solution to JAX once. No SHT iteration crosses a
  `pure_callback` or NumPy boundary; only scalar PCG convergence checks
  synchronize to the host. On a dedicated A100 the transform kernels
  beat 64-thread ducc0 by ~6× (spin-0) / ~2.5–3× (spin-2). Opt-in
  (`backend='almond'`), not selected by `'auto'`; requires the `almond`
  package installed and a GPU. **Note:** with JAX and CuPy sharing one device,
  set `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_ALLOCATOR=platform` (and `PREALLOCATE=false`) or the
  two allocators fragment the GPU and OOM at `nside ≳ 128`.

## Response (Fisher), noise bias, windows

Two engines:

- **exact** (`fisher_mode='exact'`): solve `V = M G` for all
  `(comp, l, m)` columns with batched CG and accumulate the `l`-resolved
  response tensor `T[a,b,c,d](l,l')` chunk by chunk (the dense `H = GᵀMG`
  is never stored). Exact `R`, exact noise bias `n = diag blocks of VᵀNV`,
  exact bandpower windows `F_bl` — for any binning. Cost ≈ `n_modes` CG
  solves; the default up to nside 64.

- **subsampled** (`fisher_mode='subsampled'`, `fisher_frac=f`): the exact
  engine run on a random fraction f of the mode *columns*, stratified per
  `l'` (>= 1 column each, without replacement) and renormalized by
  `N_l'/n_l'` — exactly unbiased, and since the row index of H is always
  summed exactly, the sampling error is *local in bands*:
  `offset(c_A)/sigma_A ~ SNR_A sqrt(rho (1-f)/n_A)` with the band's own
  S/N and a mask-geometry factor rho (~0.1 for the NaMaster test mask).
  Measured head-to-head at matched solve counts, its frozen-response
  offsets are 6-9x smaller than the sims-MC engine's (whose Wishart noise
  couples all bands: `offset ~ sqrt(SNR_tot^2/N_sims)`), i.e. ~40-80x
  cheaper at equal accuracy. The sampled R is symmetrized; check
  conditioning for very small f. This is the recommended scalable mode,
  combined with iteration when bands are strongly signal-dominated.
- **pseudo-Cl control variate** (`fisher_control_variate='pseudo_cl'` with
  the exact/subsampled engine): replace the sampled object by
  `R0 + sample(R_exact - R0)`, where `R0` is a deterministic MASTER-style
  coupling built with local diagonal signal+noise inverse pixel weights.  For
  spin-2 fields this diagonal uses the isotropic zero-lag Q/U signal variance
  implied by the E/B trace; the approximation is the local diagonal filter
  itself.  The control is computed in SiMaster's discrete HEALPix
  normalization using the same SHT operators, so a full-column run is
  algebraically identical to the ordinary exact engine; with
  `keep_samples=True`, the retained slabs are residuals and
  `subsample_error()` measures the residual sampling error.  This is
  experimental: a poor local-diagonal control can increase variance, so
  production runs should compare the reported suboptimality with and without
  the option.
- **mc** (`fisher_mode='mc'`): for sims `x ~ N(0, C̃)`,
  `cov[y_A, y_B] = R_AB` exactly (this also holds for the deprojected
  filter because `M C̃ M = M`), the same sims give windows
  `F_bl = cov[y_b, y_l]`, and noise-only probes give `n`.  The response
  sims must be Gaussian (the covariance identity uses Gaussian fourth
  moments; Rademacher probes would bias it through their fourth cumulant).
  The noise-bias trace `n_A = 1/2 Tr[M N M P_A]` is single-`M`, so it *is*
  plain Hutchinson estimation: there we use `N^(1/2) d` with Rademacher
  `d` (exact, since N is diagonal), which is unbiased with strictly lower
  variance than Gaussian noise draws — measured ~1.1-1.3x here; the gain
  is bounded because `P_A` is a band projector whose Frobenius mass is
  off-diagonal in pixel space, which no probe distribution suppresses. Scales to any
  nside. **Caveat:** the frozen MC noise of `R̂` adds a fixed offset to all
  estimates with rms `≈ σ_A · sqrt(SNR²_tot / n_sims)` where `SNR²_tot` is
  the *total* squared signal-to-noise summed over all bands. For
  signal-dominated data, size `n_sims` accordingly (or use exact mode, or
  iterate so that the fiducial absorbs the offset). The inverse-Wishart
  Hartlap factor is applied; residual non-Gaussian corrections to it are
  `O(n_bins/n_sims)`.

## MC Fisher uncertainty and the automatic harness

The MC engine returns a *noisy* `R̂`; like the subsampling error it does not
average away in one analysis, so `simaster.mc_fisher` quantifies it — the MC
analog of `simaster.subsample`. From a set of per-seed estimates (each `R̂` from
`nsims` draws plus its reference mean `ȳ`), `MCFisherStore` gives the combined
`F̂` and:

* **element-wise σ(F̂_ab)** — the Wishart variance
  `Var[F̂_ab] = (F_aa F_bb + F_ab²)/(N_eff − 1)`, cross-checked by the
  seed-to-seed scatter (model-free, needs ≥2 seeds). Verified: the median
  relative σ on the diagonal equals `√(2/N_eff)`.
* **error-bar calibration.** A *frozen* `F̂` (one realization, as in any real
  run) makes the bandpower *pulls* scale as `1/√h` with the Anderson–Hartlap
  factor `h = (N_eff − n_b − 2)/(N_eff − 1)` — the inverse-Wishart /
  Dodelson–Schneider effect, verified to 0.5% over `N_eff = 512…3072`. So the
  honest 1σ bandpower error bar is `√diag(F̂⁻¹)` (the Hartlap-shrunk covariance
  divided by `h`); `MCFisherStore.bandpower_cov(calibrated=True)` returns it and
  `pull → 1`. A single short MC under-covers: e.g. nside=128 `nsims=512`
  (`h≈0.43`) gives pull 1.52 while χ²/dof≈1 (misleading); averaging 6 seeds
  (`N_eff=3072`, `h≈0.91`) → pull 1.05 — seed-averaging is mandatory at high
  nside.
* **suboptimality / dRnorm** vs an exact `F` if supplied, and a **held-out χ²**
  (`held_out_chi2`) on independent sims that did *not* enter `F̂` — a
  circularity-free bias check.

Per-seed estimates are concatenable (`MCFisherStore.merge`), so a distributed
run saves one store per rank and merges them. See `compute_mc_error`.

### Automatic harness (`simaster.run_auto`, `simaster.fisher_auto`)

`run_auto(scheduler, problem, nside, outdir, k='auto', …)` runs the whole
workflow over a pluggable `Scheduler`:

  i.   **pilot** — time a deflation-`k` grid and pick the `k` minimising MC wall
       (harvest + `nsims`·per-solve); for ducc at nside=128 this is a shallow
       basin around `k≈800` (CG iters keep falling with `k` but per-solve
       flattens and harvest grows).
  ii.  **MC** — `n_seeds` independent seeds at the optimal `k`, one per rank.
  iii. **combine** — merge into `F̂` + uncertainty (`compute_mc_error`) and a
       held-out-χ² check.

The `Scheduler` ABC's only contract is "run
`python -m simaster.fisher_worker … --rank R` for `R` in `0..n−1`, in parallel,
and block". `LocalScheduler` runs ranks in-process (portable, any machine). HPC
backends live outside the portable core: `simaster.nersc.SlurmScheduler` fans
ranks out with `srun` *inside one allocation*, so the entire pilot→MC→combine
runs as a **single** SLURM job (never a job array) — see
`simaster/nersc/run_auto.sh`. A *problem* is any importable module exposing
`build_workspace(nside, *, fisher_mode, deflation, cg_tol, …) -> QMLWorkspace`.

## Bands, junk bands, aliasing

Bandpowers are flat in `C_l` over user bands; SiMaster automatically adds
"junk" bands so the band basis covers every multipole in `[lmin, lmax]`.
All bands are estimated jointly and the junk bands are marginalized (full
`R⁻¹`), not reported. **The covariance model is bandlimited at `lmax`**
(default `3 nside − 1`): power in the data above `lmax` is not modeled and
will alias — choose `lmax`/resolution so that signal+noise above it is
negligible. Validation simulations are generated bandlimited, making the
model exact.

Monopole and dipole of every spin-0 field are deprojected by default
(`deproject_low_ell`), since `l < 2` is outside the band basis.

## Template marginalization

Two equivalent prescriptions (validated against each other):

- `template_alpha = α` (finite): adds `α_rel · tr(C)/||t||² · t tᵀ` to `C`,
  the classic "large prefactor" recipe. The same term is included when
  drawing MC sims, keeping `R` consistent. Very large `α` degrades CG
  conditioning; `α ≲ 1e6` is safe in double precision.
- `template_alpha = None` (default): the exact `α → ∞` limit via
  Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury,
  `M = C⁻¹ − C⁻¹T (TᵀC⁻¹T)⁻¹ TᵀC⁻¹`, implemented as one extra batched
  solve for `C⁻¹T`. Numerically stable, exactly nulls the template
  directions.

## Numeric caveats (summary)

1. Everything is float64; QML quadratic forms difference large numbers and
   float32 is not supported.
2. CG tolerance (default 1e-5) enters the filter; data and sims use the
   same filter so the leading effect cancels in `R⁻¹y`, but do not relax it
   beyond ~1e-4.
3. MC-mode frozen-`R̂` offsets: see above.
4. The bandlimit/aliasing caveat: see above. HEALPix quadrature
   non-orthonormality (up to ±70% Gram-eigenvalue spread at
   `l = 3 nside − 1`) is *not* an error source for the estimator — `Y` is
   part of the model — but it does inflate the variance of the highest
   bands and is why the top bands near `3 nside` should be treated as junk.
5. Window functions: with a curved input spectrum, compare estimates to
   `QMLWorkspace.predict(cl_theory)` (window-convolved), not to naively
   binned theory.

## The around-fiducial (sim-debiased) estimator

With a stochastic response matrix (subsampled or MC engines), the plain
estimator `ĉ = R̂⁻¹(ŷ − n̂)` carries a frozen bias `R⁻¹δR̂·c_true` for *any*
fiducial. The around-fiducial form

```
ĉ = c_fid + R̂⁻¹( ŷ(d) − ⟨ŷ⟩_fid-sims )      (QMLWorkspace.run_mean_debias)
```

uses the mean of ŷ over ~1/ε² (~100) independent fiducial sims, which has
expectation `R_true·c_fid + n_true` with the *exact* response of the actual
filter — so the R̂ error multiplies `(c_true − c_fid)` instead of `c_true`
(verified: a 20%-wrong fiducial deflates subsampled offsets by exactly the
predicted ×5). Combined with one `iterate()` re-centering this is what makes
stochastic response engines viable for signal-dominated data; see the report
for the Planck-scale budget. The fiducial bandpowers used in this form are
band means of the fiducial spectra — exact when the fiducial is band-flat
(which `update_fiducial` guarantees).

## Field-level likelihood, score, and autodiff

`simaster.score` exposes the exact-likelihood view. The quadratic term
`-1/2 d^T C^-1 d` is differentiable through the CG solve with
`lax.custom_linear_solve` (implicit differentiation: the backward pass is
one extra solve), and `jax.grad` of it w.r.t. the bandpowers reproduces the
QML statistic `y_A` to machine precision (tested). The log-det term never
needs evaluating: its gradient `-1/2 Tr[C^-1 P_A]` is a single-solve
Hutchinson trace satisfying `1/2 Tr[C^-1 P_A] = n_A + (R c_fid)_A`, so the
full score is `y - n - R c_fid` — QML is the Newton step on this likelihood.
Second derivatives do *not* get cheaper via autodiff (the Hessian is the
double-solve trace; one solve per band per probe), so the subsampled-column
engine remains the Fisher method of choice; Hessian-*vector* products cost
~2 solves and enable truncated-Newton optimization or HMC over bandpowers,
and gradients w.r.t. any upstream parametrization (cosmological parameters,
calibration, beams) chain through `clmat` for free.

## Exact Hessian: second-order likelihood expansion (`exact_hessian`)

`QMLWorkspace.exact_hessian(data)` returns the **exact** gradient and Hessian
of the Gaussian log-likelihood in the bandpower basis, evaluated at the
current fiducial `c0` for one (or a batch of) data realization(s). For
`-2 lnL = dᵀ C⁻¹ d + ln det C` with `C(c)` *linear* in the bandpowers (so
`C_{,ij} = 0`), writing `M = C⁻¹`:

```
∂_A lnL   = ½ dᵀ M C_A M d − ½ Tr(M C_A)          = y_A − ⟨y_A⟩
∂²_AB lnL = F_AB − Q_AB
   F_AB = ½ Tr(M C_A M C_B)        (the response/Fisher matrix R)
   Q_AB = dᵀ M C_A M C_B M d = (C_A z)ᵀ M (C_B z),     z = M d.
```

Because `E[d dᵀ] = C`, `E[Q] = 2F` and hence `E[hess] = −F`, recovering the
Fisher matrix in the mean. The point is that `exact_hessian` keeps the *data*
term `Q` rather than its expectation, so `−hess = Q − F` is the genuine
per-realization curvature. The gradient is exactly the QML score
`y − n − R c_fid` of the previous section.

The data term is matrix-free and cheap. With `z = M d` (one CG solve) and
`v_A = C_A z = U E_A Uᵀ z = from_modes(E_A · to_modes(z))` (a band/spectrum
projection in harmonic space, no new SHTs), `Q = Vᵀ M V` needs one further
batched CG solve per band parameter — `1 + n_param` solves total, far fewer
than the per-mode response. `C_A` here is exactly the operator behind the
`y`-statistic (the symmetric `U_i E_b U_jᵀ + U_j E_b U_iᵀ` for a cross-band),
so `F`, `y` and `Q` are mutually consistent and the result is validated
against the dense `F − dᵀMC_AMC_BMd` to CG tolerance.

This is meant for treating a good fiducial's first and second derivatives as
the whole inference — a pure 2nd-order (Gaussian) expansion
`lnL(c) ≈ lnL(c0) + grad·(c−c0) + ½(c−c0)ᵀ hess (c−c0)`. The implied MLE is
the single Newton step `c0 + (−hess)⁻¹ grad` with parameter covariance
`(−hess)⁻¹`; `LikelihoodExpansion.newton_estimate()` does this with the exact
curvature, `fisher_estimate()` with `F` (always SPD). `hess`, `grad` and `F`
span the full band set (user **and** junk bands, both real parameters); the
estimate helpers therefore **marginalize** over the junk bands — invert the
full matrix, then restrict — rather than conditioning on them (which slicing
the Hessian would do). `−hess` is SPD only in expectation, so for a noisy
realization `newton_estimate(floor=…)` clips its eigenvalues; with a good
fiducial (`Q ≈ 2F`) it is typically already SPD.

## Radical compression (offset-lognormal likelihood, Bond–Jaffe–Knox 2000)

`simaster.compress(workspace, result)` reduces a QML estimate to the BJK
triplet `{c_hat, x, F}` (`CompressedLikelihood`, with `save`/`load` and a
callable `loglike`). The x-factors generalize the ideal `x_l = N_l/B_l^2`
through the exact identity `c_hat + x = R^-1 y` (total signal+noise power,
BJK's D-hat): `x = R^-1 n`, available exactly from the workspace response
and noise bias. The likelihood is Gaussian in `Z_b = ln(c_b + x_b)` for
auto-spectra with weight `M^(Z) = (c_hat+x) F (c_hat+x)`; cross-spectra
(which can be negative) stay Gaussian, as is standard. Verified against
the exact dense likelihood at nside=8: |delta(-2lnL)| <~ 1 within +-1.5
sigma even for the lowest Delta_l=5 band, always better than a plain
Gaussian out to 3 sigma; the far low-C tail of the exact likelihood is
steeper than lognormal (anti-conservative for lower limits — BJK's known
limitation, driven by nu-heterogeneity within wide low-l bands; use
narrower low-l bands if the deep tail matters). At high l the form
converges to Gaussian, so compression only changes anything at large
scales — QML territory.

## Curved fiducial + flat deviations (`estimate(deviations=True)`)

Instead of modelling the spectrum as flat within bands, keep the full
smooth (curved-in-l) fiducial C_l^fid inside the covariance and fit only
flat band deviations away from it:

```
dc = R^-1 ( y(d) - ybar_fid ),    ybar_fid = F_bl C^fid_l + n,
```

with ybar_fid deterministic and exact in the exact/subsampled engines (the
l-resolved windows F_bl are available; mc mode uses the sim mean). Then
E[dc] = R^-1 F (c_true - c_fid)_l — identically zero at the fiducial and
free of flat-band binning bias otherwise, since all spectral curvature
lives in the fiducial. `iterate(deviations=True)` adds the fitted flat
deviations to the smooth fiducial each step (preserving its shape) instead
of replacing it by flat bandpowers. This is the recommended mode whenever
a good smooth fiducial exists (CMB, LCDM-like LSS): the bandpower windows
then only matter at second order in the residual.
